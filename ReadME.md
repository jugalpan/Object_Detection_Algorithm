Course: Computer Vision
Purpose: Research Project
Topic: Object Detecting Filter comparision
Code: Python, OpenCV

This project is divided into 2 parts. First one compares the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) Algorithm, Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) Algorithm and the Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) Algorithm. Second one compares Shi-Tomasi Filter and the Harris Filter which are widely used filters used in Object Detection.

All these algorithms are only implemented from the existing research and are NOT invented.
